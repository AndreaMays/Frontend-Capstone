#The ARCC App:
This app is a website to provide the South Nashville community with information about how and when to pickup free groceries. The user can decide if they will like to pickup groceries or if they are in an area where dropoffs happen. The user can also see the groceries that are coming for the week(s).  The user will submit a form each week to signup for groceries. The user will also have the ability to inform the resource center that there is a food allergy and to hold a product for health reasons. Lastly, the user can see every order they have made and have the ability to delete or edit their previous grocery order if needed. 

Motivation:
I wanted to create this app to actually try and meet a need in the South Nashville community.  The church/resource center that hands out these groceries, is committed to reaching as many people in need as possible. However, with that mission they do not have a website or app to display their resources. So as groceries where being handed out, people in need where actually being left out because the resource center did not know a particular person was in need. This app is to help mitigate any person in need being looked over.
